  "Manufacturing": "Criminal rates 10% above the cross-sector figure; published breach costs USD 5.00M against a 4.44M average. Production stoppage usually carries the loss. Leak-site tallies put this sector at about a quarter of all victims, but that reflects how many organisations it contains, not a higher risk per organisation.",
  "Transport & logistics": "No adjustment: no normalised incidence figure exists for this sector, which means no measured difference rather than no risk. Availability carries the loss, and the chain frequently enters through a third party - carrier, forwarder, port or terminal system - so model that stakeholder and what it grants access to.",
  "Retail & consumer": "No adjustment: no normalised incidence figure exists for this sector. Payment and customer data drive the loss. Exposure is strongly seasonal, which the model does not represent - it computes an annual average, so a scenario aimed at peak trading is understated.",
  "Technology & telecom": "State-actor rates doubled, largely for onward access to customers. A compromise here becomes somebody else's initial access, which belongs in their study as a supply-chain entry, not only in yours.",
