// Effect classification of security measures: WHICH risk factor a control moves.
// A measure is not defined, for quantification purposes, by how much work it is but
// by its mechanism - deterring an attempt, removing the exposure, resisting a step,
// detecting an intrusion in time, or recovering from the loss. Each class therefore
// has its own channel into the model instead of all of them landing on "resistance".
//
// The class is read from the measure's own `measure_type` field; an unclassified
// measure falls back to Preventive (the historical behaviour), and the completeness
// linter surfaces it so the default stays visible rather than silent.
