// Deriving the requirements that apply to a record, from the catalogue that states them.
//
// A publisher that classifies its requirements - "this one applies to network connections"
// - has already written down which requirements reach which object. The work then is not
// to decide, but to apply: classify the object, widen the class along the publisher's own
// hierarchy, collect, and de-duplicate. That is mechanical, and doing it by hand over a
// thousand requirements is where the errors come from.
//
// Nothing here knows a method. It works from two declarations in the taxonomy:
//
//   · a field on some type whose `vocabulary` names a source (the object's class),
//   · a field on the catalogue-backed type whose `vocabulary` names the same source
//     (the classes a catalogue item applies to),
//
// plus, optionally, that vocabulary's hierarchy (Taxonomy.vocabularyHierarchy), which says
// which class is a special case of which. Declare none of it and nothing is derived.
