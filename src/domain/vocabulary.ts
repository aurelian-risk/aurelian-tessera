// Refreshing a taxonomy's vocabularies from the catalogue that defines them.
//
// A profile that works to a published ruleset carries lists the publisher owns: the
// practices a requirement can belong to, the object categories it applies to, the modal
// verbs it uses. Typed into the taxonomy by hand, those lists are a copy that ages
// silently — nothing fails when the publisher adds a category, the value simply never
// appears in the picker.
//
// A field says where its values come from (`FieldDef.vocabulary`, see types.ts), and this
// module reads them back out of a parsed catalogue. The engine knows the mechanism; which
// fields take part, and from which property, is the taxonomy's business.
//
// Two rules the merge follows:
//  · A value a record still holds is never dropped. The catalogue may have retired it;
//    the study has not, and an option that vanishes takes the record's value with it.
//  · Values that stay keep their position. The publisher's document order is an accident
//    of where a term happens to appear first; the profile's order is a decision.
