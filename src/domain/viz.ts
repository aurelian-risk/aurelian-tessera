// BLUE second band in the risk matrix, and a binary green/amber in the coverage matrix.
// They were not reconcilable by reading - the same 57% was three colours on one screen.

// (v-1)/(max-1) gives 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1. Read on GOODNESS - 1 is good - and `badColor`

// guessed from the name of the quantity.
//
// The one deliberate exception is `heatColor` below: where a figure is read as a
// percentage across a whole range (the tactic tiles), a continuous ramp says more than
// four steps. Nothing else may invent its own edges.
