// One search across the whole study - every workshop, every entity type.
//
// The tables can each be searched where they stand, which answers "where in this list is
// it". It does not answer the question an analyst actually arrives with: "we wrote
// something about the maintenance gateway - where?" The answer to that is spread over
// five workshops and a dozen types, and looking for it meant opening each in turn.
//
// Nothing here knows the taxonomy of any product: types, groups and fields are read from
// the taxonomy, so a profile that renames its workshops is searched by its own names.
// The matching itself is `matchesQuery`/`haystack` from tablefilter - the same rules the
// tables use (all terms must appear, quotes hold a phrase together, values are compared
// as they are DISPLAYED), because two search boxes that disagree about what "matches"
// means are worse than one.
