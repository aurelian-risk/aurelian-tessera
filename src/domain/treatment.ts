//
// The effect is read from the SAME model the quantification runs: the kill chain is
// traversed with and without the controls, and the two runs are compared. That matters,
// because the two used to disagree. The old version averaged every measure on the chain
// into one "coverage" figure and moved the risk down by it - so a scenario defended
// purely by monitoring, or by backups, looked reduced in the matrix while the
// quantification of the same scenario said most attempts still reach their objective.
//
// Reading the effect from the simulation also splits it correctly across the two axes:
//   likelihood <- how far the controls cut the loss-event FREQUENCY (deterrence,
//                 avoidance, resistance and interruption all land here)
//   gravity    <- how far they cut the loss MAGNITUDE (recovery and containment)
// so a treatment that only buys recovery moves the risk DOWN, not left - which is
// exactly what recovery does.
//
// Decisions:
//   Reduce -> both axes move by what the measures achieve on each
//   Share  -> impact is transferred (e.g. insurance): gravity drops, by at least a level
//   Accept -> residual = inherent
//   Avoid  -> risk eliminated (minimum)
//
// The mitigating measures are NOT re-listed on the treatment: they already attach to the
// risk THROUGH the kill chain (measure covers step -> step in operational scenario ->
// implements the strategic scenario).
