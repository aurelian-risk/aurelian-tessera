//
// Deliberately NOT part of the study. An arrangement is a property of the person reading,
// not of the analysis: put it in the study and it travels in the export, turns up in an
// import diff as a change to review, and lands in the hash-chained log - so collapsing a
// group would be recorded as an edit to the assessment. It lives in localStorage instead,
// in its own keys, and nothing here ever touches the study.
//
// Three things keep it from becoming a burden on the browser:
//
//  · Only the deviation is stored. Groups are open, columns are shown and nodes sit where
//    the layout put them by default, so the payload is the size of what someone changed,
//    not of what they have. A table of 1200 requirements left as it comes costs nothing.
//  · Writes are coalesced. Clicking through ten groups writes once, not ten times -
//    localStorage is synchronous, and a write per click is a stall per click.
//  · It is bounded and self-evicting. Scopes are capped and the least recently seen ones
//    go first, so a year of opened studies cannot grow without limit.
