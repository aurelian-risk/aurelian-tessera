   *  from before the key existed, and filtering the chosen recipients against it gives an
   *  empty set. The archive path survives that (`encryptBytesToRecipients` refuses an empty
   *  list); the TEXT path does not: `exportToFile` reads `recipients?.length`, falls through
   *  to a password that is empty in this mode, and downloads the study as a plain .json.
   *  Reproduced end to end - a file the reader had addressed to a key, in clear.

   *  of at most a few hundred bytes, once per export, and correctness is not a trade here. */
