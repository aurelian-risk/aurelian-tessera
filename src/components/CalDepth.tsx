            One measure at &quot;{levels[level]}&quot; protects {pct(eff)} of this step. That lifts
            the skill needed here from &quot;better than {pct(DEMAND)} of attackers&quot; to
            &quot;better than {pct(Math.min(1, DEMAND + effect.prevention * eff))}&quot;, and the
            share getting through falls from {pct1(pts[0].through)} to {pct1(pts[1].through)} out of 100.
            {" "}A second measure only matters in the cases where the first one failed, which are
            few, so it takes that to {pct1(pts[2].through)} and a third to {pct1(pts[3].through)}.
            That is why layers on one step run out quickly - and why the same measures achieve
            more spread across different steps of the chain, where an attacker has to clear each
            of them.
          </>}
        {" "}The maths assumes the measures fail independently of each other. Two that depend on
        the same administrator, platform or bypass do not, and this picture flatters them.
